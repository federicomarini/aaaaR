# `aaaaR` - Let the aminoacids do the talking!

Did you ever wonder how a string would be encoded as aminoacid sequence? And most
importantly, did you ever wonder why no one did it before?

Then you found the right package!


Install it:

```
devtools::install_github("federicomarini/aaaaR")
```

Load it and use it right away:

```
library("aaaaR")
aaaar("Federico")
```
